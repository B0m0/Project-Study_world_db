# Project-Study_world_db
Study_world_db focuses on understanding global dynamics through data on language, population, and age. Using MySQL, I cleaned datasets, calculated key performance indicators (KPIs), and performed exploratory analysis. Interactive Power BI dashboards visualize insights to help stakeholders make informed decisions.
